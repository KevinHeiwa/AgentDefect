Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet contains a direct error in the 'for' loop within the `search` function. Specifically, the final 'for result in res' loop is redundant and incorrect because 'res' is expected to be a dictionary (as seen from the way it is accessed earlier in the code). Iterating over a dictionary directly would only iterate over its keys, which would not have a 'content' key. This will result in a runtime error if executed. of SearxSearchTool in llm_agents/tools/searx.py.


Exist TRE Defect, the tool RemoteTool in erniebot-agent/src/erniebot_agent/tools/remote_tool.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a direct error in the comment on line 22. The comment contains double backticks (`tool_name_prefix``) instead of single backticks (`tool_name_prefix`). This is a typographical error that could lead to confusion.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a syntax error in the function definition. The return type annotation '(Union)[ToolInvokeMessage, list[ToolInvokeMessage]]' is invalid. It should be 'Union[ToolInvokeMessage, list[ToolInvokeMessage]]' instead. of YuqueDescribeBookTableOfContentsTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/aliyuque/tools/describe_book_table_of_contents.py.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet contains a direct error where the 'strip' method is incorrectly called on 'parsed_url.path' in 'parsed_url.path.strip("/")'. The 'strip' method expects a string argument, but the 'path' attribute of a parsed URL object is a string. The correct usage should not have this issue, so the direct error is the incorrect assumption about the method's argument. of AliYuqueDescribeDocumentContentTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/aliyuque/tools/describe_document_content.py.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The syntax for the return type annotation in the '_invoke' method is incorrect. '(Union)[ToolInvokeMessage, list[ToolInvokeMessage]]' is invalid and should be written as 'Union[ToolInvokeMessage, list[ToolInvokeMessage]]'. of YuqueDescribeBookTableOfContentsTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/aliyuque/tools/update_book_table_of_contents.py.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is an indentation error in the commented-out line: '#           result += f"Full response: {json.dumps(response, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)}"'. The indentation of this line does not align with the surrounding code structure. of ApplyGuardrailTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/aws/tools/apply_guardrail.py.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The console_handler.flush() call at the end of the _invoke method is misplaced and seems to be outside the scope of normal execution. It will not execute as it is placed after the 'except' block, making it unreachable due to the preceding 'return' statements within the try and except blocks. of LambdaYamlToJsonTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/aws/tools/lambda_yaml_to_json.py.

 
Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet contains a direct error in the '_get_sign' method. The variable 'str' is being used as a variable name, which overrides the built-in 'str' type in Python. This is a direct error as it shadows the built-in type, which can lead to unexpected behavior. of BaiduFieldTranslateTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/baidu_translate/tools/fieldtranslate.py.

 
 Exist TRE Defect, the tool BingSearchTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/bing/tools/bing_web_search.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: validate_credentials. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:In the '_invoke_bing' method, there is an issue in the construction of the 'related searches' JSON result under the 'result_type == "json"' block. Specifically, it incorrectly iterates over the 'news' variable instead of 'related_searches' when constructing the 'related searches' field.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method 'set_xticklabels' is used without first setting the x-ticks using 'set_xticks', which can lead to a direct runtime error. The 'ax.set_xticks(range(len(data)))' should be called before 'ax.set_xticklabels(axis, rotation=45, ha="right")'. of BarChartTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/chart/tools/bar.py.
 
 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method 'set_xticklabels' is used in the code without first calling 'set_xticks' to define the tick positions, which may lead to a direct runtime error in Matplotlib. This is because 'set_xticklabels' assumes corresponding tick positions are already defined. of LinearChartTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/chart/tools/line.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The attribute 'is_success' used on the 'res' object from the httpx library is incorrect. The correct attribute is 'res.is_successful' or 'res.status_code' should be checked explicitly to verify success (e.g., status code 200). of DiscordWebhookTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/discord/tools/discord_webhook.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The type annotation for the 'tool_parameters' argument in the '_invoke' method uses 'dict[str, Any]', which is invalid in Python versions prior to 3.9. In Python 3.8 and earlier, the correct syntax would be 'Dict[str, Any]' from the 'typing' module. of DuckDuckGoImageSearchTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/duckduckgo/tools/ddgo_img.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:In the function '_invoke', the type hinting for the function's return type is incorrect. The '|' operator for union types is not valid in Python versions below 3.10. For compatibility with Python versions below 3.10, the correct type hinting should use 'Union[ToolInvokeMessage, list[ToolInvokeMessage]]' from the 'typing' module instead. of DuckDuckGoNewsSearchTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/duckduckgo/tools/ddgo_news.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect, the tool DuckDuckGoVideoSearchTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/duckduckgo/tools/ddgo_video.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Exist empty function, detail: compile() arg 1 must be a string, bytes or AST object. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The code for the tool is missing entirely (None is provided instead of an implementation), which is a direct error as there is no functional code to evaluate.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method 'is_success' used on the 'res' object from the 'httpx.post' response is incorrect. The correct attribute to check for a successful response in 'httpx' is 'res.is_successful' or directly comparing 'res.status_code' to a successful status code like 200. of FeishuGroupBotTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/feishu/tools/feishu_group_bot.py.


 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method 'create_text_message' is called in the '_invoke' method, but its definition is missing in the provided code snippet. Similarly, 'create_json_message' is also called, but its definition is not present. This constitutes a direct error since these methods are essential for the tool's functionality and are not defined or inherited from the provided context. of GitlabCommitsTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/gitlab/tools/gitlab_commits.py.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a direct syntactical error in the headers dictionary in the _translate method. The 'User-Agent' string is not properly concatenated with the 'Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36' string; the lack of a comma between them causes this to be treated as a single string instead of two separate key-value pairs. This will result in a runtime error. of GoogleTranslate in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/google_translate/tools/translate.py.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method 'get_controls' is expected to return a dictionary, but it returns a tuple (fields, fields_list). This contradicts its return type annotation dict, which is a direct error in the code. of GetWorksheetFieldsTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/hap/tools/get_worksheet_fields.py.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is an incorrect attribute reference in the line 'if res.is_success:'. The correct attribute for checking the success of an HTTPX response is 'res.is_successful' or 'res.status_code == 200', depending on the intended behavior. The attribute 'is_success' does not exist in the httpx.Response object, which will lead to an AttributeError at runtime. of ListWorksheetRecordsTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/hap/tools/list_worksheet_records.py.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet contains a direct error in the `_insert` method. Specifically, the line `match.full_path.update(input_data, new_value)` is incorrect because the `update` method does not exist for `full_path`. This will raise an AttributeError during runtime. of JSONParseTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/json_process/tools/insert.py. The type hint syntax for dictionary keys and values in 'tool_parameters: dict[str, Any]' is invalid in Python versions before 3.9. In earlier versions, 'Dict[str, Any]' from the 'typing' module should be used instead. If this code is intended to run on Python 3.9 or later, there is no issue with this syntax. of JSONParseTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/json_process/tools/parse.py.


 Exist TRE Defect, the tool GooglenewsTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/rapidapi/tools/google_news.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: validate_credentials. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The validate_credentials method calls _invoke with a single argument (parameters), but _invoke expects three arguments: user_id, tool_parameters, and self (implicitly passed). This will result in a TypeError due to the mismatch in the number of arguments.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The function '_invoke' contains asynchronous code wrapped inside the 'async_invoke' function, which is executed using 'asyncio.run'. However, 'asyncio.run' cannot be called when there is an already running event loop, which is common in many environments (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, some web frameworks). This will lead to a 'RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop.' of SlidesGeneratorTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/slidespeak/tools/slides_generator.py.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The function 'img_generation' is attempting to create and return 'json_data' even when the 'if code != 0' condition is true. However, 'json_data' is only defined in the 'else' block, which means it will cause a NameError if the 'if' block is executed and the function tries to return 'json_data'. of SparkImgGeneratorTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/spark/tools/spark_img_generation.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The type hints used in the code contain syntax errors. Specifically, 'dict[str, str]' and 'dict[str, Any]' are written using a syntax only valid in Python 3.9+. Additionally, the type hint 'ToolInvokeMessage | list[ToolInvokeMessage]' uses the union operator '|' which is only valid in Python 3.10+. If the code is intended to be compatible with Python versions earlier than 3.9 or 3.10, this will cause syntax errors. of StableDiffusionTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/stability/tools/text2image.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code uses 'datetime.now(UTC)', but 'UTC' is not defined in the provided code. It should likely use 'pytz.UTC' or another valid definition of 'UTC'. of CurrentTimeTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/time/tools/current_time.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a typo in the error message string inside the '_invoke' method. The word 'datatime' should be corrected to 'datetime'. of TimezoneConversionTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/time/tools/timezone_conversion.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a direct error in the code involving the use of type hinting for dictionaries and lists. In Python versions below 3.9, the syntax 'dict[str, Any]' and 'list[ToolInvokeMessage]' is invalid, and the correct syntax would be 'Dict[str, Any]' and 'List[ToolInvokeMessage]'. This would result in a direct runtime error in environments using Python versions below 3.9. Additionally, 'Dict' and 'List' would need to be imported from the 'typing' module for type hinting to work correctly. of SendMessageTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/twilio/tools/send_message.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The attribute 'is_success' used on the 'res' object should be 'res.is_successful' or 'res.status_code == 200', as 'is_success' is not a valid attribute of the httpx.Response object. of WecomGroupBotTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/wecom/tools/wecom_group_bot.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:'souces' is misspelled in the condition 'if "souces" in response_data["queryresult"]'. It should be 'sources'. This will result in a direct error when trying to access 'sources' in the response data. of WolframAlphaTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/wolframalpha/tools/wolframalpha.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet contains a direct issue in the `img2img` method. The variable `DRAW_TEXT_OPTIONS` is used but not defined within the given code snippet, which will result in a `NameError` during execution. Similarly, the `text2img` method also uses the same undefined `DRAW_TEXT_OPTIONS` variable, causing the same issue. Additionally, in the `img2img` method, the `io` module is used without being imported, which will result in a `NameError`. These are direct issues in the implementation. of StableDiffusionTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/xinference/tools/stable_diffusion.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a direct syntax error in the line 'elif typ == "constant" and not isinstance(value, str | int | float | bool):'. The syntax 'str | int | float | bool' is invalid in Python versions prior to 3.10. For compatibility, the correct syntax would be 'isinstance(value, (str, int, float, bool))'. of ToolNodeData in api/core/workflow/nodes/tool/entities.py.

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:In the '_execute' method, the 'people_list' is returned as a list of dictionaries, but the return type in the docstring suggests it should return a string. This inconsistency could lead to confusion about the expected return type. of ApolloSearchTool in superagi/tools/apollo/apollo_search.py.
  

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code attempts to access 'result['message']' when checking for errors, but 'result' may not always have a 'message' key. Additionally, it assumes that 'choices[0]' will always be available without prior checks, which can lead to an IndexError if 'choices' is empty. of ImproveCodeTool in superagi/tools/code/improve_code.py.
  

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The '_execute' method's docstring mentions an argument 'code_file_name', but this argument is not present in the method's parameter list, leading to potential confusion and incorrect usage. of CodingTool in superagi/tools/code/write_code.py.
  

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The attribute 'agent_id' is used in the method '_execute' to find the organization, but it is not initialized with a default value in the class definition. This could lead to a 'NoneType' error when trying to use 'self.agent_id' if it has not been set before the method is called. of WriteSpecTool in superagi/tools/code/write_spec.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The variable 'code_content' is referenced in the commented-out line that attempts to save the tests to a file, but 'code_content' is never defined or assigned a value in the provided code snippet. of WriteTestTool in superagi/tools/code/write_test.py.
  

  Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The 'get_tools' method is returning a list containing an instance of 'DuckDuckGoSearchTool', but 'DuckDuckGoSearchTool' is not defined in the provided code snippet. This would lead to a NameError when the method is called. of DuckDuckGoToolkit in superagi/tools/duck_duck_go/duck_duck_go_search_toolkit.py.
  

 Exist TRE Defect, the tool ReadEmailTool in superagi/tools/email/read_email.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: _process_message. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The 'messages' variable is redefined as an empty list after being assigned the result of 'conn.select("INBOX")'. This leads to an empty list being used in the subsequent for loop, causing the loop that attempts to fetch emails to not execute as intended.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method 'imap_open' is called on 'ImapEmail' without ensuring that 'ImapEmail' is defined or imported in the code snippet. Additionally, the method 'smtp.quit()' is called after the 'with' statement, which is unnecessary and could raise an error since the SMTP connection is already closed after exiting the 'with' block. of SendEmailTool in superagi/tools/email/send_email.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:In the method send_email_with_attachment, the variable 'send_to_draft' is set to a boolean value based on the tool configuration, but there's a potential issue when checking for 'EMAIL_DRAFT_MODE'. If the configuration is not set or is an unexpected value, it defaults to 'FALSE', which is a string and not a boolean. This could lead to unexpected behavior in the condition checks. of SendEmailAttachmentTool in superagi/tools/email/send_email_attachment.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method get_previous_content returns False when an exception occurs while reading from S3, but this does not differentiate between a failure to read the file and a non-existent file. This could lead to confusion in the calling method which expects a string or None for previous_content. of AppendFileTool in superagi/tools/file/append_file.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The 'agent_id' attribute is initialized to None, which may cause issues if it is expected to be an integer. Additionally, the method '_execute' references 'self.toolkit_config.session', but 'toolkit_config' is not defined within the provided code snippet, which could lead to an AttributeError. of ListFileTool in superagi/tools/file/list_files.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code does not handle the case where the 'final_path' variable is None before it is passed to 'os.path.exists(final_path)', which may result in a TypeError when checking the existence of a path. Additionally, the variable 'temporary_file_path' is initialized as None but is used to determine if a file was found, which could lead to confusion in logic. of ReadFileTool in superagi/tools/file/read_file.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The 'resource_manager' attribute is initialized as None, but it is used in the '_execute' method without checking if it has been instantiated. This could lead to an AttributeError if '_execute' is called without a valid 'resource_manager'. of WriteFileTool in superagi/tools/file/write_file.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The header 'Authorization' is set to None if 'github_access_token' is not available. This can lead to issues when making requests to the GitHub API, as the authorization header is required for authenticated requests. of GithubAddFileTool in superagi/tools/github/add_file.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The header 'Authorization' may contain 'None' if 'github_access_token' is not set, which could lead to an invalid request when making API calls. This should be handled to ensure that the 'Authorization' header is valid. of GithubDeleteFileTool in superagi/tools/github/delete_file.py.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method '_execute' is described to return a list of all pull request ids, but it actually returns a string with a message concatenated with the string representation of 'pull_request_urls'. This is inconsistent with the method's stated return type and purpose. of GithubFetchPullRequest in superagi/tools/github/fetch_pull_request.py.


Exist TRE Defect, the tool GithubReviewPullRequest in superagi/tools/github/review_pull_request.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: run_code_review. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:In the method 'run_code_review', the response is processed to extract JSON comments. If the response does not contain valid JSON or if 'comments' key is missing, it may raise a KeyError when attempting to access 'comments['comments']'. Additionally, there is a potential issue with the way the response is cleaned up; if the response does not have the expected format, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
 

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The exception handling is too broad, as it catches all exceptions without specifying the type. This can lead to masking other errors and makes debugging difficult. It is recommended to catch specific exceptions that are expected during the execution. of GithubRepoSearchTool in superagi/tools/github/search_repo.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The default values for 'start_date', 'start_time', 'end_date', and 'end_time' are set to the string 'None', which may lead to confusion as it does not represent a valid date or time. It would be more appropriate to set these defaults to None (without quotes) to indicate that no value has been provided. of CreateEventCalendarTool in superagi/tools/google_calendar/create_calendar_event.py.

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The console_handler.flush() call at the end of the _invoke method is misplaced and seems to be outside the scope of normal execution. It will not execute as it is placed after the 'except' block, making it unreachable due to the preceding 'return' statements within the try and except blocks. of LambdaYamlToJsonTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/aws/tools/lambda_yaml_to_json.py.
 
 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet contains a direct error in the '_invoke' method where the type annotation for the 'tool_parameters' argument uses 'dict[str, Any]'. In Python versions before 3.9, this syntax is invalid because 'dict' cannot directly use square bracket type hints. To maintain compatibility with earlier versions, the correct syntax would be 'Dict[str, Any]' from the 'typing' module. Additionally, the 'json' module is used in the '_invoke_sagemaker' method, but it is not imported at the top of the code. of SageMakerTTSTool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/aws/tools/sagemaker_tts.py.
 
 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The 'random' module is used in the '_generate_random_id' method, but it is not imported in the provided code. This will result in a direct error when the '_generate_random_id' method is called. of DallE3Tool in api/core/tools/provider/builtin/azuredalle/tools/dalle3.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The check for 'event_id == "None"' should be changed to 'event_id is None' to properly check for a NoneType value. As it stands, the comparison will fail if event_id is actually None, which may lead to unintended behavior. of DeleteCalendarEventTool in superagi/tools/google_calendar/delete_calendar_event.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code does not handle the case where the 'result' dictionary does not contain the 'summary', 'start', or 'end' keys. If these keys are missing, it will raise a KeyError when trying to access them, which could result in a runtime error. of EventDetailsCalendarTool in superagi/tools/google_calendar/event_details_calendar.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet imports or references several classes and types (e.g., BaseToolkit, ABC, List, BaseTool, ToolConfiguration, ToolConfigKeyType) that are not defined within the snippet. This could lead to issues if those definitions are not included elsewhere in the codebase. of GoogleCalendarToolKit in superagi/tools/google_calendar/google_calendar_toolkit.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method '_execute' has a default parameter value of 'None' as a string for 'start_time', 'start_date', 'end_date', and 'end_time'. This may lead to confusion, as 'None' should be a NoneType, not a string. Additionally, the 'create_output_file' method generates a file name with a timestamp, but if the method is called multiple times in quick succession, it could potentially generate duplicate file names, leading to overwriting of files. of ListCalendarEventsTool in superagi/tools/google_calendar/list_calendar_events.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:In the '_execute' method, the variable 'i' is incremented without checking if it exceeds the bounds of the 'snippets', 'webpages', and 'links' lists. This could lead to an IndexError if the number of webpages is greater than the number of snippets or links. of GoogleSearchTool in superagi/tools/google_search/google_search.py.
 

 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The 'run' method does not validate the input parameters. For example, if 'detect_window' is greater than the length of 'data', it will result in an index error when slicing 'refer_data' and 'detect_data'. Additionally, there is no check to ensure that 'data' is a list of floats as expected, which can lead to potential runtime errors. of KSigmaDetector in muagent/tools/abnormal_detection.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The default value for 'history_node_list' is set to a mutable default argument (an empty list). This can lead to unexpected behavior if the method is called multiple times, as the same list instance will be used across calls. It is recommended to use None as a default value and initialize the list inside the method. of CodeRetrieval in muagent/tools/cb_query_tool.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The 'vertex' is accessed using index [0] from 'related_vertices' without checking if 'related_vertices' is empty. This can lead to an IndexError if the search result does not return any related vertices. of CodeRetrievalSingle in muagent/tools/codechat_tools.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method 'search_related_vertices' is called within the 'run' method, but it is not defined within the provided code snippet. This can lead to a runtime error when 'run' is executed if 'search_related_vertices' is not defined elsewhere. of RelatedVerticesRetrival in muagent/tools/codechat_tools.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method 'search_code_by_vertex' is called but not defined within the provided code snippet. This could lead to a runtime error if 'search_code_by_vertex' is not defined elsewhere in the codebase. of Vertex2Code in muagent/tools/codechat_tools.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The variable 'docs' is used before being assigned a value in the case of an exception being raised during the 'search_docs' call. If an exception occurs, 'docs' will be referenced in the for loop, leading to a potential UnboundLocalError. of DocRetrieval in muagent/tools/docs_retrieval.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The 'timelimit' field in ToolInputArgs uses 'None' as a valid enum value, which is not a valid option in Python enums. Enum members should be defined explicitly as constants, and 'None' should not be included in the enum declaration. of DDGSTool in muagent/tools/duckduckgo_search.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The 'run' method is missing 'self' as its first parameter, which is required for instance methods in Python classes. of MetricsQuery in muagent/tools/metrics_query.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method 'run' is defined as a static method but does not utilize the input validation or structure provided by the ToolInputArgs class. The method signature should ideally accept an instance of ToolInputArgs to ensure input validation and consistency. of Multiplier in muagent/tools/multiplier.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The 'image_path' parameter in the 'ocr_baidu_main' method is expected to be a path to an image file, but the 'run' method constructs 'image_file' using 'os.path.join(image_path, image_name)'. If 'image_path' is an empty string, this will result in 'image_file' being just 'image_name', which may not be a valid path. Additionally, if 'image_path' does not exist or is not a valid directory, this will lead to a FileNotFoundError when attempting to open the file. of BaiduOcrTool in muagent/tools/ocr_tool.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The ToolInputArgs class defines 'stock_name' as an integer, but it is expected to be a string (as indicated by the type hint in the run method). This inconsistency can lead to type-related errors when the input is processed. of StockName in muagent/tools/stock_tool.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method StockInfo.run() is expected to return an instance of ToolOutputArgs, but in the exception handling block, it returns the exception object 'e' instead of returning a ToolOutputArgs instance. This inconsistency can lead to runtime errors when the method is called and an exception occurs. of StockInfo in muagent/tools/stock_tool.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The method 'run' is intended to return an instance of 'ToolOutputArgs', but it currently returns a raw JSON response from the requests library, which may not match the expected output type. Additionally, if an exception occurs, it returns the exception object instead of a structured output, which could lead to type inconsistencies. of WeatherInfo in muagent/tools/weather.py.

 Detailed description: The return type annotation is invalid ('str|list[str]' is not valid in Python). Use 'Union[str, List[str]]' from the 'typing' module.
 
Exist TRE Defect, the tool ImageToDepth in agentlego/tools/image_depth/image_to_depth.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The docstring declares the 'device' argument twice in the Args section, which is redundant and incorrect documentation.

Exist TRE Defect, the tool ObjectRemove in agentlego/tools/image_editing/remove.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:In the constructor (__init__), there is a line where the grounding_model argument is split across two lines using a string concatenation ('glip_atss_swin-t_a' '_fpn_dyhead_pretrain_obj365'). This is an invalid syntax because the string concatenation is missing a '+' operator between the two strings. This will result in a direct syntax error.
 
Exist TRE Defect, the tool ObjectReplace in agentlego/tools/image_editing/replace.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:In the 'pad_edge' method, 'mask' is converted to a NumPy array using 'mask.numpy()', but there is no guarantee that 'mask' is a PyTorch tensor. If 'mask' is already a NumPy array, calling 'numpy()' on it will raise an AttributeError. This is a direct issue in the code.
 
Exist TRE Defect, the tool ScribbleTextToImage in agentlego/tools/image_scribble/scribble_to_image.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a duplicate argument 'model' in the docstring of the class ScribbleTextToImage. It is described twice with conflicting definitions: once as 'The model name used to inference' and once as 'The scribble controlnet model to use.' This is a documentation error that could lead to confusion.
 
Exist TRE Defect, the tool TextToBbox in agentlego/tools/object_detection/text_to_bbox.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The format string in the 'pred_tmpl' variable contains an incorrect placeholder for the score. The placeholder '{:.0f}' should be corrected to '{:.2f}' or a similar format to properly display floating-point values, as 'score * 100' will typically not be an integer.
 
Exist TRE Defect, the tool SegmentAnything in agentlego/tools/segmentation/segment_anything.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The '_is_setup' attribute is used in the 'segment_anything' method before it is defined anywhere in the class. This will raise an AttributeError on its first use.

Exist TRE Defect, the tool SegmentObject in agentlego/tools/segmentation/segment_anything.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup, show_box. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:In the `show_mask` method, the docstring has a typo in the parameter description for `transparency`. It is misspelled as `transparenccy` in the Outputs section.
 
Exist TRE Defect, the tool TextToSpeech in agentlego/tools/speech_text/text_to_speech.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The code contains a direct error in the line 'self.model = TTS(self.model_name).to(self.device).synthesizer.tts_model'. The '.to(self.device)' method is being called on the result of 'TTS(self.model_name)', which is likely not a PyTorch model or an object with a '.to()' method. This would result in an AttributeError during execution.
 
 Exist TRE defect: Defect found in get_air_quality_level.
 Detailed description: Error in range check: the condition '21 < air_quality_index <= 40' excludes the value 21, which is not consistent with the earlier range condition '<= 20'.
 
Exist TRE Defect, the tool CodeInterpreter in modelscope_agent/tools/code_interpreter/code_interpreter.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, __del__, build, terminate, reset, add_code_cell, add_markdown_cell, _display, add_output_to_cell, show_bytes_figure, _kill_kernels, _fix_matplotlib_cjk_font_issue. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:In the `__del__` method, the signal handling setup is incorrect. The `signal.signal` function is used to set signal handlers, but this does not make sense in the `__del__` method, as this method is called when the object is being garbage collected, and signal handling is unrelated to object deletion. This is a direct logic error in the code.
 
 Exist TRE Defect, the tool CodeInterpreter in modelscope_agent/tools/code_interpreter/code_interpreter_nb.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, __del__, build, terminate, reset, add_code_cell, add_markdown_cell, _display, add_output_to_cell, show_bytes_figure. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a direct indentation error in the 'terminate' method. Specifically, the 'stdin_channel', 'hb_channel', and 'control_channel' attributes of 'self.nb_client.kc' are incorrectly split across multiple lines, breaking Python's indentation rules. This will raise a syntax error during execution.
 
 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a direct indentation error on the line containing the comment '# noqa E125'. The code following the 'if' condition is indented incorrectly, violating Python's indentation rules. of QWenVL in modelscope_agent/tools/dashscope_tools/qwen_vl.py.


 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a direct error in the method `call`. On line 10, `params = self._verify_args(params)` is used, but later on line 12, `if isinstance(params, str):` checks if `params` is a string. This creates a logical contradiction because `_verify_args` is expected to process `params`, and it is unclear why it would remain a string after processing. This may lead to unexpected behavior in the code. of DocParser in modelscope_agent/tools/doc_parser.py.
 
Exist TRE Defect, the tool OpenAPIPluginTool in modelscope_agent/tools/openapi_plugin.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a direct error in the `__init__` method where `super().__init__(cfg)` is called twice. The second call is unnecessary and redundant, which could lead to unintended side effects during initialization.
 
 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:In the `jaccard_similarity` method, the function returns an integer value for the intersection of two sets, but the comment suggests it intends to calculate the Jaccard similarity. The commented-out line for the Jaccard similarity calculation is correct but not being used. This inconsistency between the comment and implementation can lead to confusion. Additionally, in the `call` method, the variable `manul` seems to be a typo and might have been intended to be `manual`, which is not an error per se but could lead to readability issues. of SimilaritySearch in modelscope_agent/tools/similarity_search.py.
 
Exist TRE Defect, the tool PaperSummaryTool in promptulate/tools/paper/tools.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: get_paper_references, get_translate, get_opinion, get_keywords, get_advice. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The variable 'paper_summary' is referenced in multiple methods (get_translate, get_opinion, get_keywords, get_advice) before it is assigned or defined within the code. This is a direct error since the variable is required as part of the prompt strings but is not initialized or defined in the provided context before being used.
 

Exist TRE Defect, the tool HtmlCanvas in src/pygpt_net/tools/html_canvas/__init__.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup, on_reload, update, toggle_edit, update_menu, set_output, reload_output, load_output, save_output, clear_output, clear_all, open, open_file, close, toggle, show_hide, toggle_icon, handle_save_as, setup_dialogs, setup_theme. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The attribute 'self.is_edit' is defined twice in the '__init__' method, which is redundant and may lead to confusion or unintended behavior..

Exist TRE Defect, the tool ImageViewer in src/pygpt_net/tools/image_viewer/__init__.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup, new, open_file, open_preview, close_preview, open_images, close_images, open, open_dir, save_by_id. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a trailing comma in the parameter list of the 'open_file' method definition (line: def open_file(self, id: str, auto_close: bool = True,)). This is a syntax error in Python..

Exist TRE Defect, the tool MediaPlayer in src/pygpt_net/tools/media_player/__init__.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: __init__, setup, update, update_menu, store_path, play, open_file, open, close, on_close, toggle, show_hide, setup_dialogs. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a commented-out block of code in the 'update_menu' method, which prevents the method from performing its intended functionality. Specifically, the code responsible for updating the menu based on the 'opened' state is commented out, effectively making the 'update_menu' method non-functional..

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The class 'CompanyInfoTool' inherits from 'lr.agent.ToolMessage', but the base class 'ToolMessage' is not defined in the provided code snippet. This could lead to a NameError if 'ToolMessage' is not properly defined or imported elsewhere. Additionally, 'CompanyInfo', 'CompanyFinancials', and 'FinalResultTool' are used in the code but are not defined or imported in the provided snippet, which would cause NameErrors if they are not defined in the broader codebase. of CompanyInfoTool in examples/basic/chat-tool-function.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The class 'AnswerTool' inherits from 'lr.ToolMessage', but the provided code snippet does not include an implementation for the class body. Specifically, there is no method or logic defined to handle the 'request' or 'purpose' attributes, nor is there any functional implementation to utilize the 'answer' attribute. This results in an incomplete class definition. of AnswerTool in examples/basic/multi-agent-search-critic-no-orch/tools.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:Direct error: In the examples method, the first example is incorrectly structured as a tuple containing a string and a cls instance, whereas the second example is only a cls instance. This inconsistency will cause issues if the method expects a uniform return type (e.g., a list of cls instances or a specific structure). of FinalAnswerTool in examples/basic/multi-agent-search-critic-no-orch/tools.py.

Invalid input or condition not covered.
Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The class AnswerTool does not have a proper indentation for its attribute declarations (e.g., 'request', 'purpose', and 'answer'). They should be properly indented within the class. of AnswerTool in examples/basic/multi-agent-search-critic/tools.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a direct error in the 'examples' method. The first example in the returned list is a tuple with two elements, but the second example is a single instance of 'cls'. This inconsistency in the structure of the list elements is a direct issue, as all elements in the list should follow the same format. of FinalAnswerTool in examples/basic/multi-agent-search-critic/tools.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code contains a direct error where the 'to' attribute is declared without using the Field function or providing a default value. This would result in a syntax or runtime error depending on the usage. of XMLSendTool in examples/basic/xml_tool.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The class 'BookInfoTool' has an issue where the attribute 'info' is defined but not initialized properly. It is declared as 'info: List[BookInfo]' but lacks an assignment or default value, which will result in a direct error when the class is instantiated. of BookInfoTool in examples/chainlit/extract-then-chat.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet lacks an implementation for the class body of 'ExportTool'. There are no methods or functionality provided, and this results in an incomplete class definition. of ExportTool in examples/chainlit/multi-agent-nested-tool.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:There is a direct error in the code where the 'purpose' string uses an f-string formatting syntax but does not include any placeholders for variables. This is unnecessary and could cause confusion. It should simply be a regular string, not an f-string. of DepGraphTool in examples/kg-chat/dependency_chatbot.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code contains a direct error because the 'answer' attribute is declared without a type annotation or initialization. In Python, class attributes typically require type annotations or initialization to avoid errors during runtime. of AnswerTool in langroid/agent/special/lance_tools.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The class definition is missing an implementation for the ToolMessage base class, which is required for the class to function properly. Additionally, the cypher_query attribute is defined but not initialized or described, which could lead to issues when the class is instantiated. of CypherCreationTool in langroid/agent/special/neo4j/tools.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The class GetTableSchemaTool references 'ToolMessage' as its parent class, but the definition or import of 'ToolMessage' is missing in the provided code snippet. Additionally, 'List' is used in the code, but it is not imported or defined, which would lead to a NameError. of GetTableSchemaTool in langroid/agent/special/sql/utils/tools.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet contains a direct error in the annotation for the examples method. Specifically, the type annotation 'List["ToolMessage" | Tuple[str, "ToolMessage"]]' is invalid. In Python, the '|' operator for type union is not valid within subscripted generics like List. The correct annotation should be 'List[Union["ToolMessage", Tuple[str, "ToolMessage"]]]'. of DuckduckgoSearchTool in langroid/agent/tools/duckduckgo_search_tool.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The return type annotation in the 'create' method is incorrect. It specifies 'Type["ReadFileTool"]' instead of 'Type["ListDirTool"]'. This is a direct error since the method is supposed to create and return a subclass of 'ListDirTool'. of ListDirTool in langroid/agent/tools/file_tools.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet has a direct syntax error in the type hinting for the 'examples' method. Specifically, the type hint 'List["ToolMessage" | Tuple[str, "ToolMessage"]]' is invalid because the syntax for union types in type hints should use 'Union' or a pipe ('|') directly without quotes around the types. The correct type hint should be 'List[Union[ToolMessage, Tuple[str, ToolMessage]]]' or 'List[ToolMessage | Tuple[str, ToolMessage]]' (if using Python 3.10+). of MetaphorSearchTool in langroid/agent/tools/metaphor_search_tool.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The code references a class named 'RecipientTool' in the line 'recipient_request_name = RecipientTool.default_value("request")', but there is no definition or import of 'RecipientTool' in the provided code. This is a direct issue as the code cannot execute without 'RecipientTool' being defined or imported. of AddRecipientTool in langroid/agent/tools/recipient_tool.py.


Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The type hint for the return type of the examples() method is incorrect. The union type syntax 'List["ToolMessage" | Tuple[str, "ToolMessage"]]' is invalid in Python. The correct syntax should be 'List[Union["ToolMessage", Tuple[str, "ToolMessage"]]]'. of RetrievalTool in langroid/agent/tools/retrieval_tool.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:In the `response` method of the `RewindTool` class, the line `agent.message_history.extend(ChatDocument.to_LLMMessage(result_doc))` appears to incorrectly use `extend` instead of `append`. `ChatDocument.to_LLMMessage(result_doc)` seems to generate a single message, whereas `extend` is typically used for adding multiple elements (iterables) to a list. This is a direct issue since `extend` would fail if `ChatDocument.to_LLMMessage(result_doc)` does not return an iterable. of RewindTool in langroid/agent/tools/rewind_tool.py.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The union type syntax 'ToolMessage | Tuple[str, ToolMessage]' used in the return type of the 'examples' method is not valid in Python. The correct syntax in standard Python is 'Union[ToolMessage, Tuple[str, ToolMessage]]'. of SegmentExtractTool in langroid/agent/tools/segment_extract_tool.py.

Exist TRE Defect, the tool XMLToolMessage in langroid/agent/xml_tool_message.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Function(s) without return: format_field. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The code snippet uses the method `str.removeprefix` and `str.removesuffix`, which are only available in Python 3.9 and later. If this code is run in a Python environment earlier than 3.9, it will result in an AttributeError. This is a direct compatibility issue.

Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The class 'PythonVersionMessage' does not inherit from a base class named 'ToolMessage' that is defined within the provided code snippet. Given the strict evaluation criteria, this is a direct error because the code assumes the existence of 'ToolMessage', which is not defined in the snippet. of PythonVersionMessage in tests/extras/test_tool_messages_azure.py.

Exist TRE Defect, the tool ComputeTool in tests/main/test_batch.py 
 missing a return value. Detail:Exist empty function, detail: compile() arg 1 must be a string, bytes or AST object. Additionally, there are issues with the tool's implementation:The tool code is missing or not provided (None)..
 
 Exist TRE Defect. There are issues with the tool's implementation:The type hint for the return value of the 'handle' method ('str | DoneTool') is incorrect in Python. The correct syntax for type unions in Python 3.10+ is 'str | DoneTool', but the code does not explicitly import the 'DoneTool' class or 'DONE' constant, so their definitions are assumed to exist outside the snippet. The issue with 'str | DoneTool' is not related to the snippet provided but to the fact that the 'DoneTool' return type   of SquareTool in tests/main/test_recipient_tool.py.


 Exist TRE Defect, the tool AugmentTool in tests/main/test_task.py
