# Agent Defect Dataset (78 single-defect agents)

This folder contains:
- `BASELINE_CLEAN/`: the defect-free baseline agent
- `ADAL-01 ... EPDD-17`: 78 agents, each injected with **exactly one** defect type.

## Notes:
- Some tools require environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `SERPAPI_API_KEY`).
- EPDD agents intentionally contain insecure behaviors. Run them only in an isolated environment.
